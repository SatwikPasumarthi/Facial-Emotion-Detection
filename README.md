# Facial-Emotion-Detection
### Introduction
Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions. The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and the model has now been developed that can recognize emotions as well.In this project, I have used the images of different emotions(like angry,sad,happy,disgust,fear,neutral) for training. Using this data, I have trained my CNN model and in the testing phase, my model takes the image from your webcam and predicts the emotion from your facial expression and display there itself on your screen.

### Purpose of the Project
This project aims to design and develop a deep learning model for detecting human emotions from facial expressions.
The ﬁnal accuracy level of my deep learning model is recorded as 0.8028 and the loss is recorded as 0.53.
The deep learning model answers 80% correctly and tell your emotion by your facial expression.

### Insrtructions:
  To run my code in your computer you have to need following packages Numpy, os, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCv.
  If your pc does'nt have those packages preinstalled. Follow the steps below
  1. Open the anaconda promt running as administrator.
  2. In the anaconda prompt write the following line for the packages you want.For this project tensorflow, keras, opencv, numpy, os. 
   >pip install packagename
   
  3. Now open the Anaconda Navigator nad install the jupyter notebook. Then load the saved model that i haved uploaded in the repository.
  4. For testing, follow  the testing section in the notebook that i have uploaded.
